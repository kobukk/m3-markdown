# Exercise-2

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.

#This is a Header about the command cd

+ Here is a nested list
  1. first bullet 
  2. second bullet 
  3. third bullet 
+ It allows you to move directories
  1. cd Documents takes you to your documents file (if that is in your wd)
  2. cd .. will take you to the parent directory
